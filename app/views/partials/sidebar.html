  <h4>About Me and Bloki</h4>
  <p>
    Bloki is a portmanteau of Loki and Blog.<br><br>
    Bloki is my first web application written with nodejs powered by LokiJS, an in-memory javascript database for nodejs, mobile and browser, which I wrote myself.
    <br><br>
    Bloki is a recursive Blog.<br>As it's meant to show off the features of LokiJS, it is a blog about how I built this blogging app.
